## 5. Pipeline overview

1. Pre-commit and pre-push hooks run before code is pushed to bitbucket repository.
2. Bitbucket runs configured pipelines (defined in bitbucket-pipelines.yml).
3. Code is merged to dev branch.

## 6. Dependency notes

This section for keeping note of dependency-related issues.

`react-native-reanimated` - set to v2.9.1 to avoid build issue in detox.
`unset-value` - version has been specified in resolutions as react-native depends on older version with a vulnerability.
